                C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.

                The Core Differences Between C and C++

C is a classic low-level procedural programming language while C++ is a superset of C that is both procedural and object-oriented. Both C and C++ are commonly used languages and though C++ is derived of C both languages need to be approached differently.

                A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is an exmaple of a C variable:
            </p>
            <code>
                int x = 10;
            </code>
            <p>
                The above code fragment declares an integer variable in the memory and stores the value 10 in it.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
            <header>
                <h1>
                    Declaring Variables

            </header>
            <p>
                A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows −
            </p>
            <code>
                type variable_list;
            </code>
            <p>
                A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there exists a variable with the given type and name so that the compiler can proceed for further compilation without requiring the complete detail about the variable. A variable definition has its meaning at the time of compilation only, the compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                The below code fragment declares and initializes three variables:
            </p>
            <code>
                /* variable definition: */<br>
                int a, b;<br>
                int c;<br>
                float f;<br>
                
                /* actual initialization */
                a = 10;<br>
                b = 20;<br>
            </code>

                In C, there are some rules to be followed while naming your variables. They are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Characters Allowed :
                    <ul>
                        <li>Underscore(_)</li>
                        <li>Capital Letters ( A – Z )</li>
                        <li>Small Letters ( a – z )</li>
                        <li>Digits ( 0 – 9 )</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Blanks & Commas are not allowed</li>
                <li>No Special Symbols other than underscore(_) are allowed</li>
                <li>First Character should be alphabet or Underscore</li>
                <li>Variable name Should not be Reserved Word</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Here are some examples of valid variable names:
            </p>
            <code>
                num<br>Num<br>Num1<br>_NUM<br>NUM_temp2
            </code>
            <p>
                Now, here are some examples of invalid variable names:
            </p>
            <code>
                int //This is a reserved word<br>float //This is a reserved word<br>continue //This is a reserved word<br>break //This is a reserved word<br>1num<br>1_num<br>365_days<br>number 1<br>num 1<br>addition of program
            </code>
            <p>
                In C, variable names are also case-sensitive
            </p>

            <p>
                Data types specify how we enter data into our programs and what type of data we enter. C language has some predefined set of data types to handle various kinds of data that we can use in our program. These datatypes have different storage capacities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data type determines the type of data a variable will hold. If a variable x is declared as int. it means x can hold only integer values. Every variable which is used in the program must be declared as what data-type it is.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>char: The most basic data type in C. It stores a single character and requires a single byte of memory in almost all compilers.</li>
                <li>int: As the name suggests, an int variable is used to store an integer.</li>
                <li>float: It is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point value) with single precision.</li>
                <li>double: It is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point value) with double precision.</li>
